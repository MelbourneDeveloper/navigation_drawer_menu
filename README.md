## Flutter Material Design Navigation Drawer Menu

[Navigation drawer](https://material.io/components/navigation-drawer) is a common UI pattern for adaptive menus. The [Material Design](https://material.io/) documentation formalizes the behavior of the menu but this pattern is not peculiar to Material Design. The pattern includes a basic Hamburger menu but isn't limited to small screens. The menu pattern suits all screen sizes. On larger width screens you see the icon and text, smaller screens will display icons only, and on phones, the menu will disappear during normal use and slide in with the hamburger icon.
